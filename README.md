This is the pytorch implementation of our paper
> Temporally and Distributionally Robust Optimization for Cold-start Recommendation

## Environment
- Anaconda 3
- python 3.7.11
- pytorch 1.10.0
- numpy 1.21.4

## TDRO
The training script of TDRO is in "Train.py". TDRO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any cold-start recommender model.
